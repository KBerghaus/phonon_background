# phonon background

This notebook calculates the phonon background relevant for sub-GeV dark matter direct detection due to high-energy background photons from radiactive contaminents in semiconductors. 
Copy the CPB folder onto your computer by either cloning the repository or downloading it directly. Needs functioning mathematica installation to run. Written and tested on Mathematica version 12.2. Notebook loads all relevant information for Si, Ge, GeAs, SiC, and Al2O3. Additional materials can easily be added by including information 
about the phonon density of states as well as the atomic or ionic form factors of the new materials. Examples and scripts used for plots in arXiv 2112.09702 are provided.
