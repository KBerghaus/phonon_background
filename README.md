This code calculates the coherent photon background spectrum in various semiconductor materials. 
Copy the directory onto your computer by either cloning the repository or downloading them directly. Specify the path to the folders at the top of the CPB_notebook.
Needs mathematica installation to run. Notebook loads all relevant information for Si, Ge, GeAs, SiC, and Al2O3. Additional materials can easily be added by including information 
about the phonon density of states as well as the atomic form factors of the new materials. Execute all chapters in notebook and then use Rate module to calculate the background spectrum.
